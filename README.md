# In Town Prototyping

The purpose of this repo is to define the work needed for the application 
and testing a couple of concepts before getting serious.

## Idea

The idea behind "In Town" is to bridge the gap between planning everyday or frequent 
travels, e.g. a business trip, a weekend trip, layovers, etc., and coordinating 
with family, friends, and/or colleagues to catch up, meet, or plan activities.

The vision for the application is to:
- identify travel plans automatically from emails / other applications
- enable notifying pre-defined groups of people of the when and where
  - only "relevant" people can be selected, i.e. those that are actually available and do not have other travelling plans
- make suggestions for activities in the area

## SLC (Small, Lovable, Complete) Planning

The application needs to be developed in several stages (SLCs). On the way, I want
to test a few concepts and functionalities to see how that works.

### SLC 1
Required features:
- manually plan journeys
- manually create users and categorize them
- manually select user / group of users
- basic (web) interface for user input
- notify user via automated WhatsApp message

### SLC 2
Required features:
- import users (as suggestions) from contacts 
- map functionality to show travel plans
- collect feedback from invited users via WhatsApp?

### SLC 3
